                    <p>
                        I am Jay Pillai, working as a software professional having several years of experience in development and project management.  Currently working in a multinational company, spanning four continents.  I have worked on several technologies primarily focused on financial solutions.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My key strength being determination and strong desire to learn new skills, I have acquired knowledge in several technologies though out my career.  I was fortunate to be part of a company which gave me opportunity to work on highly challenging projects. I have always been working in a constantly changing environment, which gave me lot of strength and adaptation skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love being outdoors, jog on a trail or doing some gardening. I have a softer side for paw-friends. One of my passions is going for an early morning motorcycle ride on a quite week-end. Love photography.  Now I am on a mission to acquire some newer web development skills.
